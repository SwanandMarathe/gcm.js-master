# gcm.js

**gcm.js** is an open source module for Titanium Android SDK that lets developers receive GCM push notifications in their Android apps.
It has a very simple API -almost identical to iOS!- yet flexible and powerful, as it executes Javascript whenever a notification is received, no matter if the app is in foreground or background. More info at:
